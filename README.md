### Hi there! I'm Rodrigo! ðŸ‘‹

I'm an enthusiastic learner and educator with a diverse academic background. My journey has led me through various disciplines and study fields.

Technology has played a significant role in my exploration of different subjects and in contributing to innovative educational approaches. Through the development and implementation of diverse courses, I've engaged with the educational landscape in dynamic ways.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineering cadet at [42rio](https://42.rio/), excited about the opportunity to collaborate, learn, and grow with like-minded individuals. ðŸ”­

ðŸ‘¯ Let's connect and explore the possibilities together! ðŸ‘¯
